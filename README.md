Hi there 👋. My name is Cory and I am learning Front-end web development at Turing School of Software & Design. I am currently learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I decided to jump into the software development world after working 4+ years with SAAS companies on the customer facing side. I'm excited for this new adventure and all there is to learn. If you would like to collab or just reach out, you can reach me at coryleesanders3@gmail.com, or at my LinkedIn page below.
