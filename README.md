My name is Cory and I am a Front End Software Engineer. I decided to jump into the software development world after working 4+ years with SAAS companies on the customer facing side.  Graduating from Turing School of Software & Design, I've become proficient in front end development with an on-the-job atmosphere that included planned sprints, meeting deadlines, test driven development, and prioritizing accessibility and user experience. If you would like to collaborate or talk software, you can reach me at coryleesanders3@gmail.com, or at my LinkedIn page below.
